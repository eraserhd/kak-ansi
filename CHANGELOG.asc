* Kakoune would not color text added to the buffer after the initial bit of
  text. (#2)
* Performance is largely improved, although Kakoune's rendering will still
  pause on some large buffers.

==== New Features

* Support for the G1 line-drawing set via ASCII SO and SI, or ESC ( 0 and
  ESC ( B.
* Support for dim, italic, underline, blink, and reverse
* Support for 256 color
