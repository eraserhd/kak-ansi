CHANGELOG
=========

== https://github.com/eraserhd/kak-ansi/compare/v0.2.4...HEAD[Unreleased]

* Support non-standard ANSI codes 90-97 (bright foreground color) and
  100-107 (bright background color), which are produced by
  `kitty @ get-text --ansi`.

== https://github.com/eraserhd/kak-ansi/compare/v0.2.3...v0.2.4[v0.2.4]

=== Added

* Support old-style ASCII line-printer emulation of bold and underscore
  by overstriking characters.  This deals with the output of `groff -c`,
  and allows Kakoune to be used as a pager for `man`.

== https://github.com/eraserhd/kak-ansi/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3[v0.2.3]

==== Fixed

* Handle `:` in escape sequences as synonymous with `;`.  This fixes the
  issue where some background colors emitted by kitty are not handled
  correctly.

== https://github.com/eraserhd/kak-ansi/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2[v0.2.2]

* Remove work-around for Kakoune bug, now that the fixed Kakuone has been
  around for a bit.
* Process escape codes in numbered stdin buffers.
* Fix line-drawing characters on Mac OS (UTF8 locale-name issue)
* Add `kak-enable` and `kak-disable`
* Many performance improvements.

== https://github.com/eraserhd/kak-ansi/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1[v0.2.1]

==== Fixed

* A work-around for a bug in Kakoune where super short text in a fifo won't
  get colored.

==== Added

* Makefile

== https://github.com/eraserhd/kak-ansi/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0[v0.2.0]

The filtering portion was rewritten in C.  It requires a C99-compatible
compiler, which should be available as `c99` on POSIX-compliant systems.

==== Fixed

* A bug in `ansi-clear` prevented subsequent `ansi-render` from working
* Kakoune would not color text added to the buffer after the initial bit of
  text. (#2)
* Performance is largely improved, although Kakoune's rendering will still
  pause on some large buffers.

==== New Features

* Support for the G1 line-drawing set via ASCII SO and SI, or ESC ( 0 and
  ESC ( B.
* Support for dim, italic, underline, blink, and reverse
* Support for 256 color
* Support for true color

=== v0.1.0
